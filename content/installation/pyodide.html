<p>There is no need to install anything on your computer to use Pyodide.</p>
<p>Inside your HTML document, include the following tags. Ideally, this should go inside your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, but it is also fine to put it inside the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<div class="code-wrapper" style="overflow-x: auto; ">
    {{< highlight html "linenos=True">}}
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.22.1/full/pyodide.js"></script>
    {{< /highlight >}}
</div>
<p class="comment-box">Note: the version of Pyodide listed above matches the most recent release of PyScript, but it is not necessarily the most recent release of Pyodide. See the <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide Docs</a> for the most recent release</p>
